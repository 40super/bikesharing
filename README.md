# CITIBIKE ANALYSIS

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to develop new findings within the citibike data. We will be looking into the citibike data and visualize any findings that are discovered and present them.

## Results

Looking through the citibike data, there were some interesting results found which will be shown.

### Number of Rides based on Gender

This pie graph shown gives information on the gender gender split based on the number of rides. One thing that stands out is that majority of rides were done by male while the female gender and the unknown gender are less than half combined.

### Top Starting Location

This graph here shows the starting location for all the citibike data but it shows it as circle markers where the darker and larger the marker, the more amount of trips started at that location.

### Duration before checkout

This graph shows the duration of all the rides in the data. As shown, majority of the data shows that most rides last less than an hour.

### Duration before checkout by gender

This is similar to the previous graph but it shows the gender difference of the amount of rides but also the duration of the rides. As a result, it shown that all genders are similar where most rides are less that an hour long in duration.

### Checkout time

This graph is a heatmap that shows the most common times that bikes are checkout. Majority of bikes are checkout in the morning around 8 am where usually work starts and checkout in the afternoon at 6 pm when work is finished.

### Checkout time By Gender

Similar to the previous graph, this shows the gender difference of checkout times throughout the day. Based on this information, all gender checkout at similar times.

### Usertype by Gender

!["User type by gender"](images/Gender%20CitiBike%20Story-8.png)

The last graph we have shows the user type and the gender as well. There are two types of users which are the normal and subscriber based user. Majority of users are males and have a subscription with the citibike business.

## Summary

When looking through the data, there were significant amount of males compare to females and unknown gender. As a result, Majority of data lean towards the male gender compare to the other genders. Two visualization I would recommend would be similar to the top starting location map but rather use gender as a filter to figure out what are some popular locations for each gender. Additionally, another graph that could help is seeing the repairs of bikes compare to the gender that uses it to see what gender requires the most uptake.
